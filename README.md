## Getting started

At first Add dependency

To use `overlapped_image_list`, add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  overlapped_image_list: ^0.0.1
  ```


## Usage

Then import

```dart
import 'package:overlapped_image_list/overlapped_image_list.dart';
```

Then use this code


```dart

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:overlapped_image_list/overlapped_image_list.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        // This is the theme of your application.
        //
        // TRY THIS: Try running your application with "flutter run". You'll see
        // the application has a purple toolbar. Then, without quitting the app,
        // try changing the seedColor in the colorScheme below to Colors.green
        // and then invoke "hot reload" (save your changes or press the "hot
        // reload" button in a Flutter-supported IDE, or press "r" if you used
        // the command line to start the app).
        //
        // Notice that the counter didn't reset back to zero; the application
        // state is not lost during the reload. To reset the state, use hot
        // restart instead.
        //
        // This works for code too, not just values: Most code changes can be
        // tested with just a hot reload.
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
        useMaterial3: true,
      ),
      home: Home(),
    );
  }
}

class Home extends StatelessWidget{
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // TODO: implement build
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('OverLapped Image List'),

      ),
